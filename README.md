# EFI-Asus-z370p-Ventura
EFI for asus z370p board hackintosh on mac os Ventura 13.5.2


specs: i7-8700, iuhd630(deactivated, but the bios for it is avaliable in the folder IUHD630), 16gb ram

Audio ports working, disabled sleep(for the integrated graphics, for some reason, it works on the rx580).


Using a MLLSE RX580 8GB 2048sp (the one with 1 HDMI, 3 display ports, NO DVI, and 8 energy pins). Cheap GPU, but try to stick with this brand and video ports, it will probally acept the same bios for the rx570 as i provided, and its a good entrance level gpu for hackintosh and way better than the IUHD630. With the flashed bios, the hackintosh should recognize it out of the box!
